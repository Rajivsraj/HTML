<h1> Software </h1>
<p> 
	Application software. The most common type of software, application software is a computer software package that performs a specific function for a user, or in some cases, for 	another application. An application can be self-contained, or it can be a group of programs that run the application for the user. Examples of modern applications include office 	suites, graphics software, databases and database management programs, web browsers, word processors, software development tools, image editors and communication platforms.
	System software. These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware. System software coordinates the activities and functions of the 	hardware and software. In addition, it controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work in. The 	OS is the best example of system software; it manages all the other computer programs. Other examples of system software include the firmware, computer language translators and 	system utilities.

<h1> Hardware </h1>
<p>
	The template for all modern computers is the Von Neumann architecture, detailed in a 1945 paper by Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. This describes a design architecture 	for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction 	register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms.[3] The meaning of the term has evolved to mean a 	stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the Von Neumann 	bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system.[4]
